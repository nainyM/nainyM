## Hi there, I am Nainy Engineer at Heart | Food & Travel Enthusiast 👋


A senior product manager responsible for multiple B2B and B2C product surfaces, from discovery to launch.

I have a knack for writing crisp PRDs that help engineering and ML teams move fast, defining model requirements, evaluation criteria, guardrails, and rollout plans.
